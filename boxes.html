            Wipeout 3 is a racing video game developed by Psygnosis and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation console, first released on 8 September 1999. In this third game in the Wipeout series, players control extremely fast anti-gravity ships in a futuristic setting and use weapons to force other contenders out of the race. Psygnosis hired the British design studio Designers Republic to develop the game's look and feel, wanting a futuristic yet plausible setting. The game's soundtrack was assembled from electronica artists including The Chemical Brothers and Orbital, as well as other performers. Critics praised Wipeout 3's audiovisual presentation, with complaints leveled at the game's unforgiving learning curve and controls. Despite overall positive reception, the game was a financial disappointment. Wipeout 3 Special Edition, featuring additional content, was released in 2000, and the next entry in the series, Wipeout Fusion, was released for the PlayStation 2 in 2002. (Full article...)
